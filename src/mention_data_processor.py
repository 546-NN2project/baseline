Mention data processing

For each token in a sentence, word phrase of lengths 1,2,...,10
is created as mention candidates. For example,

All mention candidates starting with token 'DAVAO' are as follows:

[u'DAVAO,']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', u'(AFP)']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', u'(AFP)', u'At']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', u'(AFP)', u'At', u'least']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', u'(AFP)', u'At', u'least', u'19']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', u'(AFP)', u'At', u'least', u'19', u'people']
[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', u'(AFP)', u'At', u'least', u'19', u'people', u'were']

Once candidates are identified, the code matches the actual mentions and labels
the corresponding candidate as 1 and others as 0. 

For feature processing, each mention_candidate is completed with 'PAD' tokens
up to a total length of 10 tokens. For example,

[u'DAVAO,', u'Philippines,', u'March', u'4', 'PAD', 'PAD', 'PAD', 'PAD', 'PAD', 'PAD']
